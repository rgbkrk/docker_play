docker_play
===========

Just saving off some dockerfiles I've mucked with.

# Building these Dockerfiles

```bash
$ docker build <folder_name>
```

If you want to tag the build (upon successful completion):

```bash
$ docker build <folder_name> -t rgbkrk/ipython
```

# Concrete example

```bash
$ docker build ipython
```
